<h1>Defining base classes for your project</h1>

<p>
ScalaTest is a testing <em>toolkit</em>: it consists of focused, lightweight traits that you can mix 
together to solve the problem at hand. This approach minimizes the potential for naming and implicit conflicts and
helps speed compiles.
</p>

<p>
Instead of duplicating code by mixing the same traits together repeatedly, we recommend you create abstract base
classes for your project that mix together the features you use the most. For example, you might create
a <code>UnitSpec</code> class (not trait, for speedier compiles) for unit tests that looks like:
</p>


<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">package</span> com.mycompany.myproject

<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest._

<span class="stReserved">abstract</span> <span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">UnitSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FlatSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">Matchers</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span>
  <span class="stType">OptionValues</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">Inside</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">Inspectors</span>
</pre>

<p>
You can then write unit tests for your project using the custom base class, like this:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">package</span> com.mycompany.myproject

<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest._

<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">MySpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">UnitSpec</span> {
  // Your tests here
}
</pre>

<p>
Most projects end up with multiple base classes, each focused on different kinds of tests. You might have a base class for integration tests
that require a database (perhaps named <code>DbSpec</code>), another for integration tests that require an actor system (perhaps named <code>ActorSysSpec</code>),
and another for integration test that require both a database and an actor system (perhaps named <code>DbActorSysSpec</code>), and so on.
To get started, you can just create a base class for unit testing. 
</p>

<p>
Note that in the rest of the user guide, we don't extend <code>UnitSpec</code>. Instead we show all traits involved to make it clear what is being used and make
each example work independently.
</p>

<p>
With that, it is time to <a href="writing_your_first_test">write your first test</a>.
