<h1>ScalaTest Release Notes</h1>

<a name="release192"></a>

<p>
ScalaTest 1.9.2 is a stepping-stone to help pave the way to upgrade from ScalaTest 1.9.1 to ScalaTest 2.0. Other than a few deprecations that
were coming in 2.0 anyway, 1.9.2 removes the dependency on the deprecated Scala actors library, and refactors the ScalaTest style traits into classes.
</p>

<p>
<em>Enhancements</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Removed the dependency on the old Scala actors library</li>
<li>Refactored style traits into a style class/style trait pair. The style trait for class X is now named XLike, i.e., FunSuite is now a class and FunSuiteLike the trait.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Deprecations and removals</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Deprecated <code>expectResult</code> in favor of <code>assertResult</code> in <code>org.scalatest.Assertions</code>.
<li>Deprecated <code>MustMatchersForJUnit</code> in favor of <code>ShouldMatchersForJUnit</code> in package <code>org.scalatest.junit</code>.
<li>Deprecated <code>Specs</code> in favor of <code>Suites</code> in package <code>org.scalatest</code>.
<li>Added <code>shouldEqual</code> to <code>org.scalatest.matchers.ShouldMatchers</code>.
<li>Deprecated <code>"be === <value>"</code> matcher syntax in favor of <code>shouldEqual</code>.
<li>Deprecated <code>MustMatchers</code> in favor of <code>ShouldMatchers</code> in package <code>org.scalatest.matchers</code>. This will be a good, long
deprecation cycle, during which <code>MustMatchers</code> will continue to work as before. But eventually <code>MustMatchers</code> will be removed from 
ScalaTest, after which <code>must</code> will later return to serve a different purpose.
<li>Removed long-deprecated <code>Spec</code> (renamed <code>FunSpec</code>), and the long-deprecated <code>MultipleFixture*</code> traits in <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code>.
</ul>
